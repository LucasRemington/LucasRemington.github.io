        <p> A text-based game, which was exhibited in the Visions juried showcase at Fitchburg State University. I wrote and designed the entire piece by myself.</p>
        <p> While this game was intended to be presented in an analog format, I have also created a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tdwrpo37n0dc9e8/Exist%20-%20Do%20Not%20%286%29.html?dl=0">digital copy</a>. Do note that this was copied from an early iteration, and may have some errors and typos which were not present in the final product.</p>

        <p> The final project for my Games Workshop class, a digital 2D 'downscroller'. I came up with the initial concept, created the majority of the pixel art, contributed a moderate amount of code, and designed the levels.</p> 
        <p> I would not consider the final product of this game a success, as the scope we set ended up being too large, and we had to rush the final product. However, I created a ton of pixel animations for it, and some turned out really good. You can view them in the <a href="http://lucasremington.github.io/Portfolio#DescentPX">Pixel Art</a> section of this page.</p>

        <p> A virtual-reality game developed for the 2017 Global Game Jam. I designed (but did not program) the menus and tutorial, and also created multiple <a href="http://lucasremington.github.io/Portfolio#EchoHuntPX">sprite animations to use in both.</a></p> 
        <p> This game came in second place in our venue (out of eight teams) and was a ton of fun to work on, since it was my first ever VR game. Though I wasn't too involved with the 'VR' aspect, thinking about how to explain the controls to people who couldn't actually <i>see</i> the instructions (as only one of the players would have access to the helmet) was a really cool design challenge. You can download it <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/echohunt">here.</a> </p>

        <p> A short, satirical sidescroller game about the slow decline of the Sonic franchise. It is a sequel to 'Sonic is Dead,' my friend Kenny's first Unity project. I designed this project myself, though I used many Sonic textures and music. </p> 
        <p> Since this game was not entirely based on my own intellectual property, I will not include a download link. Though parody and satire fall under fair use laws, I also really don't want to get sued.</p>

        <center> <h4 id="SwitchMaze">Switch Maze</h4>
        <p> A simple maze, with collectible objects strewn throughout it. Touching the walls kills you. Touching the floor kills you. You can toggle between first-person and third-person view, which is useful for keeping track of your position.</p>
        <p> This was a fun game to make - it's the first time I ever really messed around with the camera options in Unreal, and the system I worked out to flip between the first-person and third-person views ended up being really cool and intuitive to use. Unfortunately, it did end up being a very large game. If you want to play it, feel free to email me and I'll try to send you a download link. </p>

        <p> An analogue tactical warfare game, where players would control a 'team' of efficient operatives and attempt to either attack or defend a nuclear reactor. I designed the games signature 'simultaneous movement' mechanic, designed the characters (both narratively and visually) and wrote the final instructions for the game manual. </p> 
        <p> Pictures coming soon! I don't have the final version of the game on hand, but you can find the instructions <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KjK4nSWwE3pkKh8y_Vcp-swF0xNWU4bLLc3TtT7rMVA/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> </p>

        <p> <b>Excerpt:</b> "The tall man was watching Daryl.
            He had known someone was after him. He could feel them, itching at the back of his skull, prying into his thoughts with their machines. That’s why he had bought the gun, three days ago, passing the background check with flying colors after he had slipped the clerk a fifty dollar bill. He could feel the warm steel pressing into his armpit, safe and secure in the hidden holster underneath his coat. It reminded him of his mother's touch, for reasons he could not fully understand. Something about bullets, perhaps." </p>

        <p> <b>Excerpt:</b> "The possibility of death was (for each individual delegate) roughly one hundred percent. The possibility of being killed by the King was much less, averaging about three percent, dropping to about two point eight percent if the outlier of Raelus 6 was excluded. The death toll of the birthday party was four, bringing the number of surviving guest to one hundred and fifty. Such numbers are pleasing to human and humanlike brains. That fact isn’t especially relevant. I just thought it was interesting."" </p>

        <p> <b>Excerpt:</b> "It was unobtrusive, at first. First a simple mayo jar, once difficult to open, became impossible. Then, a few weeks later, spilled food became impossible to clean up, We lost the ability to use our arms whenever wrapped in a blanket. Doctors were baffled, but declared the developments ‘mostly harmless.’ </p>
        <p> But it got worse. Much, much worse." </p>
