        <p> A quick summary of my life so far. </p>

         <p> <b><center>My life, briefly and incompletely summarized by ten facts:</center></b> </p>
         <p> <b> 1.</b> Despite living in Massachusetts for as long as I can remember, I still hate seafood. </p>
         <p> <b> 2.</b> I have been playing and designing games since I was five years old. My first ever piece was a ripoff of Yu-Gi-Oh. Thankfully, I've had other ideas since then. </p>
         <p> <b> 3.</b> I am not a Chihuahua. However, I do wear an orange hat almost all the time. It's sort of become a trademark fashion choice. </p>
         <p> <b> 4.</b> My favorite authors are Terry Pratchett and Kurt Vonnegut, for similar reasons - namely, that while their respective narrative styles are very clear and easy to understand, they manage to tackle incredibly complex philosophical and politicial issues while being entertaining. </p>
         <p> <b> 5.</b> For many years, I attended the Wizards and Warriors LARP camp, even working as a Counselor-in-Training from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, I recieved special recognition for my performance, getting the Monster Camper of the Session award. </p>
         <p> <b> 6.</b> I'm a big fan of eSports, and follow the pro scenes of several games - notably, League of Legends, Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, and Overwatch. If you added together all of the hours I spent playing all of those games, you'd end up with way too many hours. </p>
         <p> <b> 7.</b> I'm currently attending Fitchburg State University as a Game Design major, Psychology minor. <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com#Biography">One of my pieces</a> was selected to be shown at the schoolwide juried showcase Visions in 2016. </p>
         <p> <b> 8.</b> Though I am fascinated by all forms of media, I have a particular fondness for tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons. I 'Dungeon Master' on the regular, and have worked with my schools Game Design club to host several events like the RPG night, or the Tabletop RPG DMing Talk. I am also <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com#Biography">designing a game of this sort,</a> as a special independent study with one of my professors and several other students. </p>
         <p> <b> 9.</b> I'm also very interested in developing VR games. The first time that I put on a VR headset was one of the most incredible and immersive experiences I've ever had - I  truly believe that we will come to utilize that technology extensively in future years, and am always looking for opportunities in that field. During the 2016 Game Jam, <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com#Biography">I designed the UI for one,</a> and my team came in second place out of the eight competing at my venue.
         <p> <b> 10.</b> I made this website myself, using html. It's my first time ever working with the language, so feel free to <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com#ContactInfo">contact</a> me and let me know what you think!</p>

        <center> <h4 id="DesignPhilo">Design Philosophies</h4>
        <p> How I approach creating art. </p> 
        <p> <b>Super Short Version:</b> I try to create good stuff. </p>
        </center></div>
        <div class="two-thirds column BackgroundOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
         <p> <b><center> My principles of design:</p></b></center>
         <p> <b> 1.</b> I strive to express some aspect of myself through every piece I create.</p>
         <p> <b> 2.</b> I try to learn something new from every piece I create, and make every piece as perfect as I possbily can.</p>
         <p> <b> 3.</b> I show respect to the intelligence of my audience, never putting myself or my work above them.</p>
         <p> <b> 4.</b> Good art either entertains or enlightens. Great art does both. I strive to create <i>great</i> art, though I do not always succeed.</p>
         <p> <b> 5.</b> Art can be created in any medium. However, different mediums require different approaches to create the best possible art.</p>
         <p> <b> 6.</b> What sets games apart from other mediums is the players ability to make meaningful choices.</p>
