        <p> A tabletop roleplaying game about magic and the end of the world. </p> 
        <p> <b>Super Short Version:</b> Be a wizard. </p> 
        </center></div>
        <div class="two-thirds column BackgroundOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
          <p> Traditions is a game I am developing in collaboration with two of my fellow Fitchburg State students for an independent study. </p>
          <p> It is being built around a system that will allow each player to develop their own unique magicial 'tradition,' with a complete history, ideology, and set of magical powers. The players will then work together to either prevent the end of the world, or bring it about. </p>
          <p> While still in the early stages of development, it has tested well so far, and shows a lot of promise as a concept. When an official playtest document is created, I will also post it here. </p>

          <div class="one-third column SetOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
            <center> <h4 id="Current2">Read this Book or Everyone Will Die</h4>
            <p> A book about a girl, in the future, with a bomb. </p> 
            <p> <b>Short Version:</b> The apocalypse will never get old. </p>
            </center></div>
          <div class="two-thirds column BackgroundOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
          <p> Read This Book or Everyone Will Die is an ongoing project of mine, and has gone through innumerable iterations throughout the years. </p>
          <p> Today, it is a book about the subjective nature of reality, evolutionary biology, and the consequences of extreme selfishness, all viewed through the eyes of a hyperintellectual psychic who inadvertently brings about the end of humanity. Tomorrow, it might be a book about something else. </p>
          <p> I care about this book more than any of my other projects, and as such, have not worked on it in several months for fear of disappointing myself. </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="one-third column SetOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
        <center> <h4 id="Current3">Dark World Burger</h4>
        <p> A digital game about making burgers, people, and burgers out of people. </p> 
        <p> <b>Super Short Version:</b> How Horrifying. </p>
        </center></div>
        <div class="two-thirds column BackgroundOrange" style="margin-top: 3%">
          <p> Another ongoing project, Dark World Burger started as a simple idea: a horror game based around working at a fast food resturaunt, using the 'burger-building' gameplay of tycoon games in tandem with typical RPG-style combat. </p>
          <p> It has developed into a sprawling, metatextual epic examining the divide between the 'player' and the 'character', and how much control the 'player' really has. </p>
          <P> Over the period of the next few years, I plan to assemble a team to work on a prototype for this game, possibly as another independent study. However, the narrative scope is huge, and while I have written a portion of the story, it just puts into perspective how massive this game has the potential to be. As such, I'm sitting on it for now.</P>
